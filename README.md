# Bel7 CLI

## Overview

This is a small library extracted from several Rust projects (`rabbitadmin` v2, `rabbitmq-lqt`, `frm`, and a few others).

The library is opinionated, may or may not substantially cut Rust CLI tools development time,
and therefore is unlikely to be of much interest for the general public.

## License

This library is double licensed under the Apache Software License 2.0 and the MIT license.
