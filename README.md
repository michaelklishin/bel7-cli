# Bel7 CLI

## Overview

This is a small library extracted from several Rust projects.

It is opinionated, does not substantially cut Rust CLI tools development time,
and therefore is unlikely to be of much interest for the general public.

## License

This library is double licensed under the Apache Software License 2.0 and the MIT license.
